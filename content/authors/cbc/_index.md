## About Me

Carlos Breuer Carrasco is a researcher in artificial intelligence at the University of Extremadura, where he focuses on the reproducibility and standardization of data pipelines, particularly in the context of medical image segmentation and data validation with a model-driven approach. His work bridges software engineering and deep learning, using technologies such as PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Docker, MONAI, Acceleo, and Gradio to transform high-level designs into functional, replicable tools.

With a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the University of Extremadura and a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from UNIR, he has developed convolutional neural network (CNN) models for biomedical applications, including the detection of rare diseases such as herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) from MRI scans. His experience also spans technological innovation in the insurance and industrial sectors, where he has contributed to projects involving hyperspectral image analysis and the development of systems powered by large language models (LLMs).

Carlos is particularly interested in automating the lifecycle of machine learning models, validating data transformations in scientific workflows, and translating foundation model capabilities into practical clinical tools. He complements his research with Python-based automation, and applied machine learning, maintaining a proactive approach in an ever-evolving technological landscape.
